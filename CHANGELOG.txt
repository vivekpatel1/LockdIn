LockdIn Development Changelog

February 7, 2026
Feature: Multi-Select, Bulk Delete, and UI Polish
- Multi-Select Functionality: 
  - Implemented a long-press gesture on tasks in both HistoryScreen and CalendarScreen to enter "Selection Mode".
  - Users can now select multiple tasks at once.
- Bulk Delete:
  - Added a floating delete (trash can) button that appears during selection mode to permanently delete all selected tasks.
- "Select All" Feature:
  - Added a "SELECT ALL" text button to section headers.
  - In CalendarScreen, this selects all tasks for a specific date.
  - In HistoryScreen, this selects all of "Today's Wins".
- Header Refinements:
  - Added a subtle "X" cancel button to the header to easily exit selection mode.
  - Kept header titles static ("HISTORY" / "WINS") during selection for a cleaner look, removing the dynamic "N Selected" text.
  - Fixed vertical alignment of header elements.
- UI/UX Polish:
  - Improved the centering and conditional rendering of the checkmark icon vs. text in task items.
  - Replaced the standard Switch in SettingsScreen with a custom, minimalist animated toggle to match the app's dark theme.
